# Retail-Data-Analysis
The project shows the sales insights of a Retail Store  which sells millions of products each year. 
The Data Set contains sales inputs from year 2010 to 2013. The Stores are divides into 3 segments A,B,C based on the Size and there are 45 stores abd 99 departments across all. 
One challenge of modeling retail data is the need to make decisions based on limited history. 
Holidays and select major events come once a year, and so does the chance to see how strategic decisions impacted the bottom line. 
In addition, markdowns are known to affect sales â€“ the challenge is to predict which departments will be affected and to what extent.
To track down the sales and revenue/markdown, I generated a POWER BI based report along with the dashboard to check How the Sales is affected by markdown and what is the impact on Revenue with respect to each store anually.

The reports Helps with the Insights:-
(1) Total Revenue (2)Total Markdown (3)Revenue By Store Type (4) Revenue across all store (5)Markdown Across Year on Holidays by Store Level (6) Tooltip 1- % Revenue and Markdown across all stores (7)Tooltip 2- Markdown and Revenue trend across all stores
